# Robosuite Door RL Implementation
Repository for training robot manipulator to open a door in robosuite env. Based on tutorial from Robert Cowher.

Several algorithm were implemented, including TD3, PPO, SAC. However, I only managed to make TD3 agent successfully open the door.

Each folder contain python scripts to train the agent to drive the robot. tmp folder contains the path file for training process and logs folder for tensorboard messages.
